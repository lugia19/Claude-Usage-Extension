## Installation

### Chrome

### Features
The extension will handle calculating token usage (either via Anthropic's own API if you input your own key, or via [gpt-tokenizer](https://github.com/niieani/gpt-tokenizer)).

It can pull from:
- Files uploaded to the chat (Or synced via google drive)
- Project (knowledge files and instructions)
- Personal preferences
- Message history
- The system prompt of any enabled tools (analysis tool, artifacts) on a per-chat basis
- The AI's output (This is weighted as being 10x the usage of input tokens, a rough estimate)

### Privacy
It will additionally fetch your organization ID on claude.ai to synchronize your usage amounts across devices via firebase.
See the [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md) for more information.
